  <p>
    {{ name }}'s Resting Energy Requirement (RER) is {{ rer }} kcalories per
    day. The following formula was used:
  </p>
  <div class="formula">
    RER = 70 x (body weight in kilograms)<sup>0.75</sup>
  </div>

  <h2>What is an RER?</h2>
  <p>
    The Resting Energy Rate is the minimum amount of calories {{ name }} needs
    in order to maintain

    <!-- If pet is male, use "his" instead of "him" -->
    {% if sex == 3 or sex == 4 %} {{ possessive_pronoun }} {% else %} {{
    object_pronoun }} {% endif %} metabolic processes. {{ name }} weighs {{
    weight }} {{ units }} ({{ converted_weight }} {{ converted_weight_units }}).
  </p>

  <h2>Why is the RER calculated?</h2>
  <p>
    Calculating the Resting Energy Rate is a recognized, reliable first step to
    find how many calories a pet should eat per day. However, every pet is an
    individual. While this formula works well for 50% of pets, 25% may require
    more food, while 25% require less food.

  <p>
    {% if der_low_end != der_high_end %} On the next page the Pet Food
    Calculator will calculate a range of calories per day for {{ name }}. {%
    endif %} It is important to re-weigh your pet and get an updated body
    condition score at least once a month to ensure they are being fed
    appropriately.
