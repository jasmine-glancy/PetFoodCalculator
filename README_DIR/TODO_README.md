# TODOs

This is my personal TODO list for the Pet Food Calculator.

## Future version goals

This was a project I had a lot of fun with, and I could work on it forever! I have the following goals for future versions:

- [ ] Food transition calculator

  - [ ] Help users transition their pet from their current diet to another food by providing a table in the final report

- [ ] Calculate volumetric feeding amounts per each day (5-7 days for pets that don't have a sensitive stomach, or 10-14 days for pets that have a sensitive stomach)
- [ ] Create additional route that asks for information for up to 2 new foods if the user is interested in transitioning their pet to a new food or if they are interested in feeding more than one diet
- [ ] Refactoring for speed and to reduce redundancy
- [ ] AI body condition scorer
  - [ ] Allow the user to upload several pictures of their pet (bird's eye, from the side, from the front) to attempt to determine the pet's body condition score
  - [ ] Program views the pet's photos and return recommended body condition scores with the option to allow the user to override the recommendations
- [ ] Allow users to use the calculator without logging in
- [ ] Integrate medical record software compatibility
- [ ] Recommended treat types show in the final report
  - [ ] Show up to 3 types of treats
  - [ ] Calculate commercial pet treat amounts
- [ ] Create dog and cat food and treat spreadsheets
  - [ ] Allow users to pick their diet from a drop down that calls said spreadsheet's caloric information
